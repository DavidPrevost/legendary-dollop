# Future Ideas

Ideas that are valuable but deferred to keep focus on current priorities. Review periodically for promotion to the roadmap.

---

## Deferred Features

### Skill Freshness / Decay Reminders
**Idea**: Track when users last practiced a Subject and suggest refreshers.

**Why Deferred**: Too naggy. Users may practice outside the platform. Could feel patronizing.

**Reconsider When**: We have usage data showing users want this, or can detect external practice (GitHub commits, etc.).

---

### Language Comparison Feature
**Idea**: For projects with multiple valid implementations, show side-by-side comparisons of different approaches (Flask vs Express vs Go).

**Why Deferred**: Scope creep for v1. Need solid single-language projects first.

**Reconsider When**: Core Subjects have robust project libraries and users ask "which should I use?"

---

### Alternative Project Implementations
**Idea**: Offer the same project in multiple languages as equals rather than picking a "canonical" version.

**Why Deferred**: Multiplies content workload. Better to go deep on primary implementations first.

**Reconsider When**: Community contributors want to add implementations, or we have content pipeline capacity.

---

### Gamification Elements
**Idea**: Badges, streaks, leaderboards, XP systems.

**Why Deferred**: Can undermine intrinsic motivation. Easy to do poorly. Focus on genuine value first.

**Reconsider When**: User research shows it would help engagement without cheapening the experience.

---

### Social Features
**Idea**: User profiles, sharing projects, commenting, mentorship matching.

**Why Deferred**: Requires infrastructure, moderation, privacy considerations. Phase 7 in roadmap.

**Reconsider When**: Platform has stable user base and clear community guidelines.

---

### AI-Assisted Learning
**Idea**: LLM integration for personalized hints, code review, explanations.

**Why Deferred**: Dependency on external services conflicts with offline-first. Privacy concerns.

**Reconsider When**: Local LLMs are practical, or we can offer it as optional cloud feature.

---

### Mobile App
**Idea**: Native iOS/Android apps for learning on the go.

**Why Deferred**: CLI and web-first. Mobile is consumption, we're about production.

**Reconsider When**: We have content that makes sense on mobile (theory, quizzes, progress tracking).

---

### Team/Classroom Features
**Idea**: Instructor dashboards, progress tracking for groups, curriculum assignment.

**Why Deferred**: Enterprise features distract from hobbyist focus. Phase 9 in roadmap.

**Reconsider When**: Clear demand from makerspaces, libraries, or educators.

---

### Certification Program
**Idea**: Official certificates for completing Paths or reaching Expert band.

**Why Deferred**: Certification market is crowded and often meaningless. Focus on real skills.

**Reconsider When**: Users demonstrate need for external validation (job applications, freelancing).

## Ideas to Explore

### Hardware Lending Library Integration
**Idea**: Partner with libraries/makerspaces that lend hardware to let users "check out" capabilities.

**Notes**: Cool for accessibility but complex logistics.

---

### Project Remix/Fork System
**Idea**: Let users modify existing projects and share variations.

**Notes**: Good for community but needs moderation and quality control.

---

### Offline Content Sync
**Idea**: Download specific Subjects/Paths for offline use, sync progress when back online.

**Notes**: Important for our offline-first principle. Needs careful conflict resolution.

---

### Voice-Controlled Learning
**Idea**: Navigate platform and get help via voice for accessibility.

**Notes**: Good for accessibility. Complex to implement well.

---

### AR/VR Integration
**Idea**: Visualize networks, practice hardware assembly in VR.

**Notes**: Cool but niche. Hardware requirement conflicts with accessibility.

---

### Internationalization
**Idea**: Translate platform and content to other languages.

**Notes**: Huge undertaking. Code examples are already in English. Community-driven?

---

## Rejected Ideas

### Mandatory Prerequisites
**Why Rejected**: Conflicts with Principle 6 (User Agency). We recommend, not require.

### Timed Challenges
**Why Rejected**: Creates anxiety, conflicts with "practical over perfect" ethos.

### Competitive Leaderboards
**Why Rejected**: Comparison is the thief of joy. Makers help each other.

### Subscription Paywalls
**Why Rejected**: Conflicts with accessibility. If we monetize, it's optional premium features.

## How to Add Ideas

1. Describe the idea clearly
2. Explain why it's valuable
3. Note why it's deferred (scope, complexity, principle conflict)
4. Define "reconsider when" trigger
5. Add to appropriate section

Ideas should be specific enough to implement but abstract enough to allow design flexibility.
