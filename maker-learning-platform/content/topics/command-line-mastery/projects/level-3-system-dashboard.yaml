        # export VARNAME="value"

        # Custom Prompt (optional)
        # PS1='prompt string'

dashboard_sections:
  - section: System Info
    commands:
      - hostname
      - uname -a
      - uptime

  - section: Disk Usage
    commands:
      - df -h (filtered for main disks)

  - section: Memory
    commands:
      - free -h (Linux)
      - vm_stat (macOS)

  - section: Top Processes
    commands:
      - ps aux sorted by CPU/memory

  - section: Network
    commands:
      - ip addr or ifconfig

suggested_aliases:
  - ll='ls -alh'
  - la='ls -A'
  - ..='cd ..'
  - ...='cd ../..'
  - grep='grep --color=auto'
  - df='df -h'
  - free='free -h'
  - ports='netstat -tuln'
  - myip='curl -s ifconfig.me'
  - weather='curl wttr.in'

hints:
  - level: 1
    text: Use `echo ""` for blank lines between sections

  - level: 2
    text: Pipe ps output through `sort -k3 -r | head` for top CPU users

  - level: 3
    text: Use printf for aligned columns instead of echo

extensions:
  - Add color coding for warnings (high disk usage, etc.)
  - Include network connection status
  - Create a mini-dashboard alias for quick checks
  - Add ASCII art header

reflection_questions:
  - Which system metrics are most useful for your workflow?
  - How do pipelines make this dashboard possible?
  - What aliases will you use most frequently?
