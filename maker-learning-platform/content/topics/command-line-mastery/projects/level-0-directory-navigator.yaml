        # My Maker Workspace

        This is my organized workspace for maker projects.

        ## Directory Structure

        (Document your directories here)

suggested_structure:
  - workspace/
    - projects/
      - active/
      - archive/
    - learning/
      - tutorials/
      - notes/
    - tools/
      - scripts/
      - configs/
    - resources/
      - downloads/
      - references/
    - temp/

hints:
  - level: 1
    text: Start by thinking about categories of things you'll work on

  - level: 2
    text: Use `mkdir -p` to create nested directories in one command

  - level: 3
    text: Your reference card should include absolute paths you'll use often

extensions:
  - Create aliases for quick navigation to common directories
  - Add a script that prints your workspace tree
  - Set up a bookmark system using symbolic links

reflection_questions:
  - How did you decide on your directory categories?
  - What shortcuts will save you the most time?
  - How might your structure evolve as you take on more projects?
