  - data/         # csv, json, xml
  - archives/     # zip, tar, gz

hints:
  - level: 1
    text: List files with `ls -lh` to see sizes before organizing

  - level: 2
    text: Use wildcards like `mv *.jpg media/` to move multiple files

  - level: 3
    text: Log each command with `echo "moved X to Y" >> log.txt`

extensions:
  - Handle files with no extension
  - Create subdirectories within categories (e.g., media/images, media/audio)
  - Write a script that could automate this organization

reflection_questions:
  - What was your strategy for categorizing files?
  - Which commands did you use most frequently?
  - How would you handle a folder with 1000 files?
