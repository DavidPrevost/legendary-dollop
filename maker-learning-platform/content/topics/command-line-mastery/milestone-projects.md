## Level 0: Directory Navigator

**Project**: Create a personal workspace organization system

### Description
Set up a well-organized workspace directory structure for your maker projects. Create folders with logical hierarchy, navigate efficiently, and document the structure.

### Deliverables
1. Workspace directory with organized subdirectories
2. Navigation reference card (text file with useful paths)
3. Quick navigation aliases documented

### Skills Demonstrated
- Creating directory hierarchies
- Navigating with absolute and relative paths
- Using shortcuts (~, .., -)
- Tab completion proficiency

### Success Criteria
- Workspace has at least 5 top-level directories
- Can navigate to any directory in under 3 commands
- Paths are logical and follow naming conventions
- Reference card includes all important paths

### Estimated Time
30-45 minutes

## Level 1: File Organizer

**Project**: Build a manual file organization system for downloads

### Description
Organize a messy downloads folder (or sample folder) by manually sorting files into categorized directories. Practice file operations by moving, copying, and organizing files efficiently.

### Deliverables
1. Organized directory structure by file type
2. Log file documenting all operations performed
3. Before/after directory listing comparison

### Skills Demonstrated
- Creating categorized directories
- Moving and copying files
- Viewing file details and sizes
- Understanding permissions
- Comparing directory states

### Success Criteria
- Files sorted into appropriate categories
- No files lost during organization
- Operations logged with timestamps
- Total size of each category documented

### Estimated Time
45-60 minutes

## Level 2: Log Analyzer

**Project**: Build a log file analysis toolkit

### Description
Create a set of commands to analyze sample log files. Extract useful information like error counts, unique users, peak activity times, and generate a summary report.

### Deliverables
1. Sample log file (provided or generated)
2. Command reference file with analysis commands
3. Summary report generated by your commands

### Skills Demonstrated
- Searching with grep and regex
- Sorting and counting with sort/uniq
- Extracting fields with cut/awk
- Combining tools for analysis

### Success Criteria
- Extract error count and list unique errors
- Identify top 10 most active users/IPs
- Find peak activity hours
- Generate formatted summary report

### Estimated Time
60-90 minutes

## Level 3: System Dashboard

**Project**: Build a system information dashboard using pipes

### Description
Create a command-line dashboard that displays system information by combining multiple commands with pipes. Output should be well-formatted and informative.

### Deliverables
1. Dashboard script/command that shows:
   - System info (OS, hostname, uptime)
   - Disk usage summary
   - Memory usage
   - Top 5 processes by CPU/memory
   - Network information
2. Customized shell configuration with:
   - Useful aliases
   - Environment variables
   - Custom prompt

### Skills Demonstrated
- Complex pipeline construction
- Output redirection and formatting
- Environment variable configuration
- Alias creation
- Process monitoring

### Success Criteria
- Dashboard displays all required info clearly
- Pipelines are efficient (no unnecessary steps)
- Configuration persists across sessions
- At least 5 useful aliases created

### Estimated Time
90-120 minutes

## Level 4: Backup Automation Script

**Project**: Create an automated backup system with shell scripting

### Description
Write a shell script that performs automated backups of specified directories. Include features like compression, rotation, logging, and optional remote sync.

### Deliverables
1. Backup script with:
   - Configurable source/destination
   - Compression (tar/gzip)
   - Timestamp naming
   - Retention policy (delete old backups)
   - Logging
2. Configuration file for paths and settings
3. Usage documentation
4. Cron job configuration (for scheduling)

### Skills Demonstrated
- Shell scripting (arguments, loops, conditions)
- Error handling
- File operations at scale
- Compression tools
- Network commands (optional rsync)
- Documentation

### Success Criteria
- Script handles arguments correctly
- Validates inputs and handles errors gracefully
- Creates compressed, timestamped backups
- Removes backups older than configured retention
- Logs all operations with timestamps
- Includes help/usage information

### Estimated Time
120-180 minutes

## Project Progression

| Level | Project | Output | Complexity |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| 0 | Directory Navigator | Organized workspace | Basic navigation |
| 1 | File Organizer | Sorted files + log | File operations |
| 2 | Log Analyzer | Analysis commands + report | Search + text processing |
| 3 | System Dashboard | Dashboard + shell config | Pipes + environment |
| 4 | Backup Script | Working backup system | Full scripting |

## Cross-Platform Considerations

- **Level 0-1**: Commands work similarly across platforms
- **Level 2-3**: Show both Bash and PowerShell approaches
- **Level 4**: Primary script in Bash, with PowerShell alternative noted

All projects include notes for Windows users using PowerShell or WSL.
