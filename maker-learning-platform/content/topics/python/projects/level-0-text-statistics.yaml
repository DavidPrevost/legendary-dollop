  === Text Statistics Report ===
  File: sample.txt

  Basic Statistics:
    Lines: 5
    Words: 41
    Characters: 199
    Characters (no spaces): 165

  Word Analysis:
    Average word length: 4.0 characters

  Top 10 Most Common Words:
    1. the - 4 times
    2. was - 2 times
    3. python - 2 times
    ...

hints:
  - level: 1
    text: Use split() to break text into words

  - level: 2
    text: A dictionary is perfect for counting word frequencies

  - level: 3
    text: Use sorted() with a key parameter to sort by count

extensions:
  - Add sentence count
  - Detect reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)
  - Find longest and shortest words
  - Export report to file

reflection_questions:
  - Which data structure worked best for counting words?
  - How did you handle punctuation attached to words?
  - What would you add to make this more useful?
