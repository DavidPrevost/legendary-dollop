hints:
  - level: 1
    text: Use a list to store Contact objects in ContactBook

  - level: 2
    text: For search, use 'in' operator with lower() for case-insensitive match

  - level: 3
    text: Use csv.DictWriter for CSV export with fieldnames

extensions:
  - Add contact groups/tags
  - Import from vCard format
  - Add phone number validation
  - Support multiple phone numbers per contact

reflection_questions:
  - What makes a good separation between Contact and ContactBook?
  - How did you handle duplicate contacts?
  - What would you change for a larger contact list?
