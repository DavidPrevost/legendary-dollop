  description:
    short: "Create a comprehensive personal README introducing yourself as a maker."
    full: |
      Create a personal README file that introduces yourself, your interests, and your
      maker goals. This project applies all Markdown fundamentals to produce a genuine,
      useful document similar to GitHub profile READMEs. You'll use headings, lists,
      tables, code blocks, and links to create a polished self-introduction.

  outcome: "A complete personal README in Markdown that you can use on GitHub or anywhere you need to introduce yourself"
