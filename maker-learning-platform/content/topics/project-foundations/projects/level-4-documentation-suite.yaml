  description:
    short: "Create a professional-grade documentation package for a project."
    full: |
      Create a complete documentation set that would satisfy professional project standards.
      This includes architecture documentation with diagrams, Architecture Decision Records
      (ADRs), API documentation, configuration documentation, a properly formatted changelog,
      and a reflection on your personal documentation workflow. This demonstrates mastery of
      technical documentation.

  outcome: "A complete professional documentation package demonstrating technical writing mastery"

value:
  life_improvement: |
    You can now document projects at a professional level. This skill transfers directly
    to work environments and makes your personal projects maintainable long-term. Good
    documentation is the difference between a hobby project and a serious tool.

  learning_goals:
    - Create architecture documentation with diagrams
    - Write Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
    - Document APIs clearly and completely
    - Document configuration options
    - Maintain changelogs with semantic versioning
    - Reflect on and improve documentation workflow

  unlocks:
    - Professional-grade documentation skills
    - Ready for team/enterprise environments
    - Can contribute to open source documentation

  definition_of_done: |
    The documentation package could be dropped into a professional project and meet
    team standards. A new team member could understand the architecture, key decisions,
    how to use the API, and how to configure the system without reading code.

support:
  pitfalls:
    - issue: "Architecture diagram that's just boxes with no explanation"
      solution: "Label what each component does. Show data flow with arrows. Add a legend if needed."
    - issue: "ADRs for trivial decisions"
      solution: "ADRs are for decisions with trade-offs. 'We use Python' is only an ADR if you considered alternatives."
    - issue: "API docs without examples"
      solution: "Every endpoint needs at least one example request/response. Show actual values."
    - issue: "Incomplete configuration docs"
      solution: "Document ALL options, including defaults. People shouldn't have to read code to configure."
    - issue: "Changelog with poor categorization"
      solution: "Use: Added (new), Changed (existing), Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security"

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "Use the project from Level 2 or 3—you already know it well"
    - level: 2
      hint: "For architecture diagram, start with ASCII art. You can upgrade to images later."
    - level: 3
      hint: "ADR topics: database choice, framework selection, authentication approach, deployment strategy"
