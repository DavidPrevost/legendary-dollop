  description:
    short: "Create a complete project scaffold with README, structure, and standard files."
    full: |
      Create a complete project folder structure for a real project idea. This includes
      a comprehensive README with all essential sections, proper directory organization,
      LICENSE, .gitignore, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CHANGELOG.md. The result is a project
      scaffold you can actually use as the foundation for your first real project.

  outcome: "A complete, professional project scaffold ready for development"

value:
  life_improvement: |
    You now have a project template you'll reuse for every future project. Proper
    structure from the start prevents technical debt and makes your projects
    maintainable. This scaffold can be your personal boilerplate.

  learning_goals:
    - Write comprehensive README files with all essential sections
    - Organize projects with proper directory structure
    - Select and apply appropriate open source licenses
    - Create useful .gitignore files
    - Write contributor guidelines

  unlocks:
    - Can start any project with professional structure
    - Ready to publish projects on GitHub
    - Foundation for Git/GitHub subject

  definition_of_done: |
    Someone could clone this project and understand what it does, how to set it up,
    and how to contribute—all from the documentation alone. The structure follows
    best practices for the chosen language/framework.

support:
  pitfalls:
    - issue: "Generic .gitignore that doesn't match the project"
      solution: "Use gitignore.io or GitHub's templates for your specific language"
    - issue: "Installation instructions that assume too much"
      solution: "Write as if the reader has never used this language. Include prerequisites."
    - issue: "Choosing a random license without understanding it"
      solution: "Read choosealicense.com - MIT is good for most personal projects"
    - issue: "Empty CONTRIBUTING.md"
      solution: "At minimum: how to report bugs, how to suggest features, code style basics"
