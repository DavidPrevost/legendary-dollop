  description:
    short: "A guided introduction to the Maker Learning Platform with goal-setting reflection."
    full: |
      This project introduces you to the Maker Learning Platform while helping you clarify
      your learning goals. You'll explore every major feature of the platform, set up your
      maker profile, and write a reflection document about why you want to learn to build
      things. This serves as both platform tutorial and personal motivation touchstone.

  outcome: "A configured maker profile and a personal reflection document on your learning goals"

value:
  life_improvement: |
    You'll have a clear vision for your learning journey and know exactly how to use
    the platform. The reflection document becomes something you can return to when you
    need motivation or want to remember why you started.

  learning_goals:
    - Navigate all major platform features confidently
    - Understand the platform's structure (Subjects, Levels, Projects, Bands)
    - Articulate personal learning goals
    - Practice basic documentation/writing skills

  unlocks:
    - Can confidently use the platform for all future subjects
    - Personalized recommendations based on profile
    - Clear goals to guide subject selection

  definition_of_done: |
    You have completed the platform tour, configured your maker profile with real
    information, and written a heartfelt reflection that you could read in six months
    and still feel motivated by.

support:
  pitfalls:
    - issue: "Rushing through the tour without exploring"
      solution: "Take time to click into subjects and read descriptions. This saves time later."
    - issue: "Writing generic reflection"
      solution: "Be specific. Name actual problems you want to solve, not vague 'learn to code' goals."
    - issue: "Skipping capability detection"
      solution: "Run it even if incomplete—it helps personalize your experience immediately."

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "For your reflection, start with a specific frustration you have with technology"
    - level: 2
      hint: "Think about tasks you do repeatedly that could be automated"
    - level: 3
      hint: "Your 'specific problem' could be: manual file organization, repetitive data entry, lack of personal dashboard, etc."
