  description:
    short: "Create a comprehensive project plan without writing any code."
    full: |
      Take a project idea and create a complete project plan covering problem definition,
      goals, user stories, task breakdown, time estimates, milestones, and risk analysis.
      This is pure planning—no code required. The result is a document that would guide
      the actual implementation of the project.

  outcome: "A complete project planning document that could guide implementation"

value:
  life_improvement: |
    You can now plan any project before diving into code. This prevents wasted effort,
    scope creep, and the "I don't know where to start" paralysis. Share the plan with
    collaborators or use it as your personal roadmap.

  learning_goals:
    - Define clear problems, goals, and scope
    - Write user stories with acceptance criteria
    - Break projects into manageable tasks
    - Make realistic time estimates
    - Identify and mitigate risks
    - Plan milestones and releases

  unlocks:
    - Can plan projects of any size
    - Ready for team collaboration
    - Foundation for project management

  definition_of_done: |
    A developer could pick up this plan and know exactly what to build, in what order,
    and approximately how long it will take. The plan anticipates problems and has
    clear success criteria.

support:
  pitfalls:
    - issue: "User stories that are too vague"
      solution: "'As a user, I want the app to work' is not a user story. Be specific about the action and benefit."
    - issue: "Tasks that are too large"
      solution: "If a task takes more than a day, break it down further. 'Build database' → 'Design schema', 'Create tables', etc."
    - issue: "Wildly optimistic estimates"
      solution: "Double your first instinct. Add 30% buffer for unknowns. Remember testing and docs."
    - issue: "Fake risks"
      solution: "'Might not finish' is not a risk. 'API might have rate limits' or 'Library might not support Windows' are real risks."
    - issue: "Skipping acceptance criteria"
      solution: "If you can't define when a story is done, you don't understand it yet."

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "Pick one of the suggested project ideas—they're well-scoped for planning practice"
    - level: 2
      hint: "For user stories, think about different user types: new user, returning user, admin"
    - level: 3
      hint: "Good acceptance criteria are testable: 'User can see...' 'System displays...' 'Data is saved...'"
