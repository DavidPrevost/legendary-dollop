At this level, the learner can:
- Create comprehensive README files with all essential sections
- Write clear installation and usage instructions
- Organize projects with proper directory structure
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Include standard files (LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.)
- Use README templates effectively

### Time Estimate
3-5 hours

### Milestone Project
**"Project Scaffold"** - Create a complete project scaffold for a simple automation tool. Must include: README with all essential sections, proper directory structure, LICENSE, .gitignore, and a CONTRIBUTING.md stub. The README should have installation instructions that actually work.

## Level 3: Builder

**Band**: Competent
**Theme**: "I can plan before I build"

### Concepts Covered
- Module 6: Project Planning Basics (concepts 131-152)
- Module 7: Planning Tools and Techniques (concepts 153-180)
- Module 8: Estimation and Time Management (concepts 181-198)

**Total**: 68 concepts

### Learning Outcomes
At this level, the learner can:
- Define clear project goals and scope
- Break down projects into manageable tasks
- Write user stories and acceptance criteria
- Use Kanban boards for task management
- Create and manage issues
- Make reasonable time estimates
- Plan milestones and releases

### Time Estimate
4-6 hours

### Milestone Project
**"Project Planner"** - Take a project idea (provided or your own) and create a complete project plan: problem statement, goals, scope, user stories with acceptance criteria, task breakdown, Kanban board setup, milestones, and time estimates. No code required—this is pure planning.

---

## Level 4: Maker

**Band**: Proficient
**Theme**: "I document like a professional"

### Concepts Covered
- Module 9: Technical Documentation (concepts 199-221)
- Module 10: Documentation Workflow (concepts 222-241)
- Module 11: Planning Your First Project (concepts 242-255)

**Total**: 57 concepts

### Learning Outcomes
At this level, the learner can:
- Create architecture documentation and decision records
- Document APIs and configuration
- Maintain changelogs with semantic versioning
- Follow a documentation review process
- Keep documentation current alongside code
- Apply all learned skills to real projects
- Develop personal documentation/planning systems

### Time Estimate
5-7 hours

### Milestone Project
**"Documentation Suite"** - Create a complete documentation package for a real or hypothetical project: architecture overview with diagrams, at least one ADR (Architecture Decision Record), API documentation for 3+ endpoints, configuration documentation, CHANGELOG with proper formatting, and a release plan. Then write a reflection on your personal documentation/planning workflow.

## Why These Breakpoints

### Level 0 → 1 Break
After Level 0, the user understands the "why" and is ready to learn the "how" (Markdown).

### Level 1 → 2 Break
After Level 1, the user can write formatted text. Level 2 applies this to real project artifacts (READMEs, structure).

### Level 2 → 3 Break
After Level 2, the user can document. Level 3 teaches them to plan before documenting/building.

### Level 3 → 4 Break
After Level 3, the user can plan simple projects. Level 4 adds professional-grade technical documentation and workflow practices.

## Notes

- Level 0 serves as the **platform tutorial**. All users should complete this before other subjects.
- Levels 0-1 are required for most other subjects (documentation skills are universal).
- Level 2+ can be skipped by experienced users via placement assessment.
- This subject integrates naturally with Git/GitHub (Level 2+) and all coding subjects.
