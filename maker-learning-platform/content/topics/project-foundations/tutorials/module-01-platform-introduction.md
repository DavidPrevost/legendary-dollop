# Module 1: Platform Introduction

Welcome to the Maker Learning Platform! This module introduces you to the platform and gets you set up for your learning journey.

## 1.1 Understanding the Platform

### What is the Maker Learning Platform?

The Maker Learning Platform is a learning system for **hobbyists and tinkerers** who want to understand and control their digital world. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on job preparation, this platform helps you:

- **Automate your home** and daily tasks
- **Understand your technology stack** instead of just using it
- **Build useful personal tools** that solve real problems in your life

Every project on this platform produces something you'll actually use. No "hello world" exercises that go nowhere—real projects with real value.

### Who Is This For?

**Primary audience:**
- Homelab enthusiasts
- Smart home tinkerers
- Digital homesteaders seeking tech independence
- Curious generalists who want to understand how things work
- People who see code as a tool, not a career goal

**What about careers?**
The platform can grow with you. If you start by automating your coffee maker and later decide to become a DevOps engineer, the same platform supports that journey. But you don't have to want a tech job to belong here.

### The Maker Mindset

This platform embodies certain values:

1. **Practical over perfect** - Working code that solves your problem beats elegant code that doesn't ship
2. **Breadth over depth (initially)** - The maker who can write a script, configure a container, and solder a sensor is more empowered than a specialist
3. **Real problems** - Every project should improve your actual daily life
4. **No gatekeeping** - You choose your path; we just make suggestions

## 1.2 How Learning is Structured

### Subjects

Everything you can learn is called a **Subject**. Subjects come in two types:

- **Languages** - Programming, markup, or configuration languages (Python, HTML, YAML)
- **Topics** - Technical knowledge that isn't a language (Git, Networking, Home Automation)

You're currently in the **Project Foundations** subject, which is a Topic.

### Levels

Within each Subject, you progress through **Levels**. Each Subject defines its own levels (typically 3-7), with names like:

- **Curious** - "What's this about?"
- **Explorer** - "I can follow tutorials"
- **Tinkerer** - "I can modify existing code"
- **Builder** - "I can create from scratch"
- **Maker** - "I design complex systems"
- **Architect** - "I design for others"
- **Mentor** - "I teach and contribute"

Different Subjects have different depths. Python might have 7 levels while Markdown has 3—and that's okay. Some things are naturally deeper than others.

### Bands

To compare progress across Subjects, we use **Bands**:

| Band | Typical Levels | Meaning |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Novice | 0-1 | Following tutorials, basic syntax |
| Competent | 2-3 | Modifying code, building from scratch |
| Proficient | 4-5 | Complex projects, system design |
| Expert | 6+ | Teaching, contributing to the platform |

So if you're "Python Level 4 (Maker)" and "Markdown Level 2 (Competent)", you're in the Proficient band for Python and Competent band for Markdown.

### Projects

Each level has at least one **Milestone Project** that demonstrates mastery. Projects:

- Solve a real problem
- Produce something useful
- Combine multiple concepts
- Have clear completion criteria

You don't just read and memorize—you build things that matter to you.

## 1.3 Navigating the Platform

### Main Menu

When you launch the platform, you'll see the main menu with options like:

```
MAKER LEARNING PLATFORM

1. Explore Subjects     - Browse what you can learn
2. My Progress         - See your current status
3. Continue Learning   - Resume where you left off
4. Check Capabilities  - See what tools you have
5. Settings           - Configure the platform
6. Help               - Get assistance
```

### Exploring Subjects

The Subject explorer shows all available Subjects organized by category and tier:

- **Tier 1 (Foundation)** - Start here: Python, HTML/CSS, Git
- **Tier 2 (Expand)** - Build on foundations: Docker, Go, Networking
- **Tier 3 (Specialized)** - Niche interests: Rust, Kotlin, IoT

Each Subject shows:
- Description
- Number of levels
- Prerequisites (recommended, not required)
- Your current progress

### Your Progress Dashboard

The progress view shows:
- Subjects you've started
- Your current level in each
- Band summary (how many Subjects in each band)
- Recent activity
- Suggested next steps

### Starting a Project

When you start a project, you'll see:
- Project description and goals
- What you'll create
- Prerequisites
- Estimated time
- Success criteria

You can then work through the tutorials and exercises at your own pace.

### Completing Projects

Projects have automated checks and manual review criteria. The platform tells you:
- Which automated checks passed/failed
- Manual criteria to self-verify
- Whether you've met the "definition of done"

## 1.4 Your Learning Profile

### Creating Your Profile

Your profile helps the platform personalize your experience:

- **Display name** - How you want to be addressed
- **Interests** - What kinds of projects interest you (home automation, web dev, etc.)
- **Goals** - What you want to achieve (1-3 specific goals)
- **Pace** - Your preferred learning intensity

### Capability Detection

The platform can detect what hardware and software you have available:

- Operating system
- Available languages (Python, Node, etc.)
- Development tools (Git, Docker, etc.)
- Hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)

This helps recommend projects that match your setup. You can also manually add capabilities.

### Progress Persistence

Your progress is saved locally on your computer. This means:
- No account required to start
- Your data stays on your machine
- Works offline
- You control your data
